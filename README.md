# Bolt V.3

Starting with Neo4j 3.0 a binary protocol called Bolt is supported.

It is based on the PackStream serialization.

+ Cypher Types
+ Protocol Versioning
+ Authentication
+ TLS via certificates
+ Smart client routing for clusters.
+ Load balancing and failover for clusters.

## Bolt Types

| Bolt | Python 3 | Java | JavaScript | C# |
| ---- | -------- | ---- | ---------- | -- |
| null | None | null | null | null |
| List | list | List<Object> | Array | IList<object> |
| Map  | dict | Map<String, Object> | Object | IDictionary<string, object> |
| Boolean | bool | boolean | Boolean | bool |
| Integer | int | long | Integer | long |
| Float | float | double | Number | double |
| String (UTF-8) | str | String | String | string |
| ByteArray | bytearray | byte[] | Int8Array | byte[] |

| Bolt | Python 3 | Java | JavaScript | C# |
| ---- | -------- | ---- | ---------- | -- |
| Date | neotime.Date | LocalDate | Date | LocalDate |
| Time | neotime.Time | OffsetTime | Time | OffsetTime |
| LocalTime | neotime.Time | LocalTime | LocalTime | LocalTime |
| DateTime | neotime.DateTime | ZonedDateTime | DateTime | ZonedDateTime |
| LocalDateTime | neotime.DateTime | LocalDateTime | LocalDateTime | LocalDateTime |
| Duration | neotime.Duration | IsoDuration | Duration | Duration |
  
| Bolt | Python 3 | Java | JavaScript | C# |
| ---- | -------- | ---- | ---------- | -- |
| Point | Point | Point | Point | Point |
| Node | Node | Node | Node | INode |
| Relationship | Relationship | Relationship | Relationship | IRelationship |
| Path | Path | Path | Path | IPath |

**Note:** Node, Relationship and Path can only be found in query results.

JavaScript has no native integer type so a custom Integer type is provided. For convenience, this can be disabled through configuration so that the native Number type is used instead. Note that this can lead to a loss of precision.

C# DateTime zone names adhere to the https://www.iana.org/time-zones
