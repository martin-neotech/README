# Bolt V.3

Starting with Neo4j 3.0 a binary protocol called Bolt is supported.

It is based on the PackStream serialization.

+ Cypher Types
+ Protocol Versioning
+ Authentication
+ TLS via certificates
+ Smart client routing for clusters.
+ Load balancing and failover for clusters.

## Bolt Types

| Bolt | Python 3 | Java | JavaScript | C# |
| ---- | -------- | ---- | ---------- | -- |
| null | None | null | null | null |
| List | list | List<Object> | Array | IList<object> |
| Map  | dict | Map<String, Object> | Object | IDictionary<string, object> |
| Boolean | bool | boolean | Boolean | bool |
| Integer (64 bits) | int | [long](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html) | Integer | long |
| Float (64 bits) | float | [double](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html) | Number | double |
| String (UTF-8) | str | String | String | string |
| ByteArray | bytearray | byte[] | Int8Array | byte[] |

| Bolt | Description | Python 3 | Java | JavaScript | C# |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- | ---- | ---------- | -- |
| Date | A date without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system. Example: `2007-12-03` | neotime.Date | LocalDate | Date | LocalDate |
| Time | A time with an offset from UTC/Greenwich in the ISO-8601 calendar system, Example: `10:15:30+01:00` | neotime.Time | OffsetTime | Time | OffsetTime |
| LocalTime | A time without a explicit time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system. Example: `10:15:30` | neotime.Time | LocalTime | LocalTime | LocalTime |
| DateTime | A date-time with a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system. Example: `2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00 Europe/Paris` | neotime.DateTime | ZonedDateTime | DateTime | ZonedDateTime |
| LocalDateTime | A date-time without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system. Example: `2007-12-03T10:15:30` | neotime.DateTime | LocalDateTime | LocalDateTime | LocalDateTime |
| Duration | A temporal amount. | neotime.Duration | IsoDuration | Duration | Duration |
  
| Bolt | Description | Python 3 | Java | JavaScript | C# |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- | ---- | ---------- | -- |
| Node | Snapshot of a node within a graph database. | Node | Node | Node | INode |
| Relationship | Snapshot of a relationship within a graph database. | Relationship | Relationship | Relationship | IRelationship |
| Path | Alternating sequence of nodes and relationships. | Path | Path | Path | IPath |


| Bolt | Description | Python 3 | Java | JavaScript | C# |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- | ---- | ---------- | -- |
| Point | Represents a single location in 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional space. | Point | Point | Point | Point |


**Note:** Node, Relationship and Path can only be found in query results.

**JavaScript:** Has no native integer type so a custom Integer type is provided. For convenience, this can be disabled through configuration so that the native Number type is used instead. Note that this can lead to a loss of precision.

**C#:** DateTime zone names adhere to the https://www.iana.org/time-zones

**Python 3:**

int do not have a maximum. But is restricted to the Bolt Integer type range.

Floating point numbers are usually implemented using double in C; information about the precision and internal representation of floating point numbers for the machine on which your program is running is available in sys.float_info.

**Java:** The long data type is a 64-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and a maximum value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (inclusive).
